# Copy this file to .env in the apps/mobile directory

# Required: Supabase connection details (prefixed with EXPO_PUBLIC_ for Expo to expose them to client code)
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321     # For local: http://localhost:54321, For production: https://your-project.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key         # Your Supabase anon/public key (safe to include in client code)
