# Mobile App Environment Variables
# This file serves as an example of the environment variables needed for the mobile app
# Copy this file to .env in the apps/mobile directory
# (Or preferably, use the sync-env.sh script to generate it from the root .env)

# Required: Supabase connection details (prefixed with EXPO_PUBLIC_ for Expo to expose them to client code)
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321     # For local: http://localhost:54321
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key         # Your Supabase anon/public key

# Note: The mobile app requires these environment variables to be in the app's local .env file
# even if they are also defined at the monorepo root level.
# IMPORTANT: Do not include service role keys or other sensitive variables here.
