# Expo Supabase Monorepo

![social-preview-dark](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcee6db2-6dd0-435f-8255-3f4b36b4cfdc)

## Introduction

This monorepo contains a React Native application with Expo and Supabase integration, structured to provide clean separation of concerns and strong type safety. It integrates various technologies such as Expo Router for navigation, Tailwind CSS for styling, React-Hook-Form for form handling, Zod for schema validation, and TypeScript for type safety.

## Structure

This monorepo is organized into the following packages:

- `apps/mobile`: The React Native + Expo application
- `packages/shared`: Shared utilities, types, and components
- `packages/supabase`: Supabase migrations, edge functions, and database management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- PNPM v10+
- Docker (for local Supabase)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the mobile app
pnpm dev:mobile
```

## Environment Setup

The project supports different environments:

- Development: `.env.development`
- Staging: `.env.staging`
- Production: `.env.production`

Copy `.env.example` to create these files with the appropriate values.

## Commands

### Main Commands

- `pnpm dev:mobile`: Start the mobile app (using direct PNPM filtering)
- `pnpm android`: Run on Android
- `pnpm ios`: Run on iOS
- `pnpm web`: Run on web
- `pnpm lint`: Lint all packages
- `pnpm typecheck`: Type check all packages
- `pnpm build`: Build all packages
- `pnpm gen:types`: Generate TypeScript types from Supabase

### PNPM vs Turborepo

This monorepo uses both direct PNPM workspace filtering and Turborepo for different use cases:

#### Direct PNPM Filtering
```bash
pnpm --filter <package-name> <command>
```

- Used for interactive development scripts (`pnpm dev:mobile`)
- Maintains stdin/stdout passthrough for interactive CLI tools
- Best for development servers that require user input
- Example: `pnpm --filter mobile dev:mobile`

#### Turborepo
```bash
pnpm <command>:turbo
```

- Used for build pipelines with complex dependencies
- Provides caching and optimized execution
- Best for CI/CD and non-interactive tasks
- Example: `pnpm dev:mobile:turbo` (alternative for CI/CD environments)

Choose the appropriate approach based on your needs:
- Use direct PNPM filtering for daily development
- Use Turborepo for build processes and CI/CD pipelines

## Monorepo Development Workflow

### Working with Packages

When developing across multiple packages:

1. **Make changes in the shared package**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/shared
   # Edit files...
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Use the changes in the mobile app**:
   ```bash
   # Changes are automatically available due to workspace references
   cd apps/mobile
   pnpm dev:mobile
   ```

### Common Workflows

- **Adding a new shared utility**:
  1. Create the utility in `packages/shared/src/utils/`
  2. Export it in the appropriate index.ts file
  3. Run `pnpm build` in the shared package
  4. Import from `@monorepo/shared` in the mobile app

- **Creating Supabase edge functions**:
  1. Add function in `packages/supabase/functions/`
  2. Test locally with `cd packages/supabase && supabase functions serve`
  3. Deploy with `pnpm --filter @monorepo/supabase deploy:functions`

- **Generating database types**:
  1. Make schema changes in Supabase
  2. Run `pnpm gen:types` to update TypeScript definitions
  3. Types are available throughout the monorepo

## Benefits of This Monorepo

### Strong Type Safety

By generating TypeScript types from your Supabase schema and enhancing them with custom interfaces, you get end-to-end type safety from your database to your UI.

### Environment Management

The configuration system allows for seamless switching between development, staging, and production environments, making testing and deployment more reliable.

### Code Sharing

The shared package enables you to reuse code between your mobile app and potentially other future applications, reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.

### Efficient Dependency Management

PNPM's efficient structure saves disk space and speeds up installation times, particularly valuable as the project grows.

### Centralized Supabase Management

Having all Supabase components (migrations, functions, seeds) in one package makes it easier to track changes to your backend and maintain consistency across environments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Metro bundler can't find dependencies**
  - Ensure your metro.config.js is properly configured to look in both the package's and root node_modules
  - Try clearing Metro cache: `cd apps/mobile && npx expo start -c`

- **Type errors with shared package imports**
  - Run `pnpm build` in the shared package to ensure type definitions are current
  - Check that tsconfig.json paths are correctly configured

- **Interactive commands not working through Turborepo**
  - Use direct PNPM filtering instead: `pnpm --filter mobile dev:mobile`
  - Interactive CLI tools work best with direct filtering

- **Dependency version conflicts**
  - Check for duplicate dependencies with `pnpm why <package-name>`
  - Use consistent versions across packages when possible
